CSV import :: <br>
This tool allows you to import a csv file. It must contain two columns. 
<UL type="circle">
<LI>The first one should contain a header corresponding to one present in the grid (case sensitive). 
The values have to specifically identify one line (for example a peptide sequence).</LI>
<LI>The second column should contain a header not present yet in the grid and the same 
number of values as the first column.</LI>
</UL>
This operation will add a column in the grid.
